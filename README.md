# Butterfly-Ballot
Did the butterfly ballot cost Al Gore the 2000 Election (Linear Modeling)

In the 2000 Presidential Election, Palm Beach County, Florida adopted a new kind of ballot, known as the "Butterfly Ballot" 
because of its unique voting design. This new design may have misled voters to incorrectly vote for Buchanan, the Reform candidate, 
rather than Al Gore, the Democratic candidate. This would eventually cause the Presidential vote to tip to Republican in Florida, 
leading to a George Bush victory. In this analysis, I will study whether voters mistakenly voted for Buchanan because of ballot 
modification.
